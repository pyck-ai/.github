# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment
Our project is committed to fostering an open, inclusive, and respectful
community for everyone. We believe in treating all individuals with fairness and
equality, creating an environment where every human is valued and can
contribute. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for behavior and the
consequences for violations, ensuring a safe and productive space for all
participants.

## Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for **enforcing these standards fairly and
consistently**, clarifying expectations, and taking appropriate, proportionate
action in response to unacceptable behavior. They are committed to fostering a
safe and respectful environment.

## Our Standards
To maintain a positive and productive community, we expect all members to:
* **Be Respectful and Empathetic:** Engage politely, professionally, and
  empathetically, valuing every individual's perspectives and experiences.
  Always remember there's a human behind every interaction.
* **Be Open and Welcoming:** Embrace new ideas and individuals. Actively work to
  make newcomers feel at ease and valued, contributing to an environment where
  all can thrive.
* **Be Collaborative and Patient:** Work together constructively, share
  knowledge, and offer help. Be patient with others, understanding that
  different levels of experience exist.
* **Provide Constructive Criticism:** When giving feedback, focus on the
  content, not the person. Offer specific, actionable suggestions aimed at
  improving the work, delivered considerately.
* **Prioritize Community Well-being:** Act in ways that benefit the community as
  a whole, ensuring discussions are accessible and all members have an
  opportunity to contribute.

## Unacceptable Behavior
The following actions are strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated:
* **Harassment:** This includes offensive comments (e.g., related to age,
  identity, physical appearance, or any other personal attribute), sexualized
  imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, unwelcome attention, or any
  behavior that creates a hostile environment.
* **Personal Attacks and Trolling:** Using insulting, demeaning, or belittling
  language directed at an individual. This also covers intentionally provoking
  arguments, making inflammatory statements, or "baiting" others to disrupt
  discussions.
* **Publishing Private Information:** Sharing others' personal data (e.g.,
  addresses, emails) without their explicit consent.
* **Threats or Incitement:** Any language or behavior that suggests or
  encourages physical harm or violence.
* **Advocating for Prohibited Behavior:** Supporting or encouraging others to
  engage in any of the unacceptable behaviors listed above.

## Reporting Guidelines
If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, please report it immediately
and discreetly to ensure a prompt and fair resolution.
* **How to Report:** Contact our dedicated team via conduct@pyck.ai or directly
  message a project maintainer.
* **What to Include:** Please provide details such as the names or aliases of
  those involved, a description of the incident (what, when, where), and any
  supporting evidence.
* **Confidentiality:** All reports are treated with the utmost confidentiality,
  focusing on addressing the behavior, not exposing the reporter.
* **Prompt Response:** We commit to acknowledging your report within 72 hours
  and initiating a thorough investigation.
* **Fair Process:** All involved parties will have an opportunity to present
  their side, and actions taken will be proportionate to the violation.

## Enforcement Process
Upon receiving a report, our team will:
* **Investigate Thoroughly:** Review the incident, gather necessary information,
  and ensure all parties can provide their perspective.
* **Determine Action:** Based on findings, apply appropriate consequences, which
  may include warnings, temporary bans from project spaces, or permanent
  expulsion.
* **Communicate Decision:** Inform the reporter and involved parties of the
  outcome and actions taken.
* **Appeal Process:** An appeal process will be available for those who feel a
  decision was unjust; details will be provided upon request.
* **Contribution Removal:** We reserve the right to remove content (comments,
  code, etc.) that violates this Code of Conduct.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when
representing the project.
